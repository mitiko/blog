<span class="l1">If you really wanna know peace,
really wanna know me -
loosen all those strings.</span>
Are you stuck in the dark?
If you're not growin' in no trees,
find out where the roots be.
Standin' in your own G's, yeah.
Be no other man,
take you as you can.
Be no other, be no other;
be no other man.

<span class="l1">You gotta smile in the face of the things that make you mad</span>
'cause trust me, in hindsight, you woulda wished you had.
I know sometimes your brain keeps tellin' you can't
<span class="l1">but you're better off listenin' to your belly tellin' you you can.</span>
I know sometimes you woulda wished you ran
'cause you feel like just another grain of sand
especially 'cause you feel like you're alone
and find it easier than to just call for a hand.
<span class="l1">You find it really hard to talk to your fam.
You find it easier to relate to a brand.</span>
And every time you go to reach out
it's like you forget what you thought
and say they wouldn't understand.
<span class="l1">But I just know that they would if they knew;
they're just like you, shit that needs workin' through.
How long you gonna keep lettin' it hurt on you?</span>
Ain't it long walkin' 'round like you got points to prove?

If you really wanna know peace,
really wanna know me -
loosen all those strings.
Are you stuck in the dark?
If you're not growin' in no trees,
find out where the roots be.
Standin' in your own G's... yeah.
Be no other man,
take you as you can.
Be no other, be no other, be no other man.

You're feelin' lost, you're feelin' dazed, you're feelin' confused.
Deletin' posts 'cause you feel like they don't got views.
<span class="l1">Chattin' to your camera even though you know that's not you.</span>
Now you feel like you're defined by them numbers
even though you know that it's not true.
<span class="l1">You know that none of it matters though and all of it's fake.
You're sittin' thinkin' that these ideas are goin' to waste
but what's the bigger mistake, huh?
Showin' face or bein' stuck in the same fuckin' place?</span>

But I know how it feels and I know it's a lot.
<span class="l2">You probably are everything that you say that you're not.
Is it really worth dyin' over? Maybe not.</span>
But you're here now, so just give it everything you got.
Trust, there's no rush (_no rush_).
You're probably doin' more than enough (_than enough_).
And I really not wanna talk tough
but you gotta learn how to tell people, **shut the fuck up**!
