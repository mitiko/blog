I only showed up to tell you
everyone at this party's a vampire.
This ain't red wine.
We're all food for the bloodsuckers
movin' up under the moonlight
like the vampires.

Baby, careful inside where you step.
Can you feel the weight of the eyes on your neck?
Passed me on the way down descendin' the stairs
and the whole room is watchin' while pretendin' to dance.
It was close 'cause you don't know if you're standin' a chance
on your own, right, I know you didn't make any plans.
<span class="l1">And when the clock strikes twelve at night, you be doin' hella white
with somebody you don't even like, talkin' 'bout your life..</span>

One, two..
Are we dead, is this really red wine?
Will you feel and live, die? Yeah.
Take me back when I'm feelin' stressed out
'cause it's nearing that time.

<span class="l1">I only showed up to tell you

This ain't red wine.</span>
We're all food for the bloodsuckers
movin' up under the moonlight
like the vampires.

They can tell that your mind is a mess _mind is a mess_.
<span class="l1">Take someone you don't even like to your bed.</span>
When it's over, you roll out, you come down the stairs
<span class="l1">and there's no sign, the party vanished into thin air -
just like a ghost town, your best friends weren't even there
and the whole time, you realized you don't even care.</span>
When that alarm strikes seven like, goin' on your feather-white
bed of white lies, last night was a set up.

One, two..
Are we dead, is this really red wine?
Will you feel and live, die? Yeah.
Take me back when I'm feelin' stressed out
'cause it's nearing that time.
