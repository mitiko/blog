I can't move on, baby doll
waitin' on calls, flippin' through stations.
<span class="l1">I'm outclassed and it's outrageous!</span>
And I'll take it all, baby doll,
whatever's been weighin' you down.

Find me on Miami concrete
lookin' for somebody different
'cause my daddy was a pimp.
My mama had her issues but I miss her anyway.
Oh, baby doll.
<span class="l1">Please don't call me for the wrong reasons,
we both know exactly what I'm thinkin'!</span>
Weeks pass and I never grow tired
<span class="l1">'cause I never said never and I barely ever lie.</span>
I'm on the road to an original place.. in outer space
I didn't make it up
but you can't find it on a phone or a globe.
And I can take you with me if you really wanna go.
Oh, baby doll, I can't move on!

And I can't move on, baby doll
waitin' on calls, flippin' through stations.
I'm outclassed and it's outrageous!
<span class="l1">And I'll take it all, baby doll,
whatever's been weighin' you down.</span>
