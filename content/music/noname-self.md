Maybe this the album you listen to in your car,
when you driving home late at night
really questioning every god, religion, Kanye, bitches.
<span class="l1">Maybe this is the entrance before you get to the river.</span>
I had him before the heathen. No reason for you to like me.

<span class="l1">Maybe this your wifey just wanting a clean divorce.</span>
The baby ain't really yours.
That's really for babies teething
and chicken wings under-seasoned.

<span class="l1">Y'all really thought a bitch couldn't rap, huh?</span>
Maybe this your answer for that.
A crack era, the Reagan administration?
And niggas are still scared of-

Nah, actually this is for me.
This one for TT at the lakes offering the mac and the cheese.
This one a small apology for all the calls that I screened.

Mr. money man, Mr. every day he got me,
<span class="l1">Mr. wifing me down, Mr. me love, Mr. Miyagi,
Miscellaneous, Mr. molly inside my saki.
Incredible, incredible emptiness in my body.</span>

Heaven's only four-feet tall -
I set my ringer to it.
Fucked your rapper homie, now his ass is making better music.
My pussy teaching ninth-grade English.
<span class="l1">My pussy wrote a thesis on colonialism
in conversation with a marginal system in love with Jesus.</span>

And y'all still thought a bitch couldn't rap huh?
Maybe this your answer for that.
<span class="l1">Good pussy, I know niggas only talk about money and good pussy.</span>
