<span class="l1">I've been making time for tunes,
making tunes a plenty.</span>
Find me at the boombox,
at the party sippin' henny.
There's many times a day
I've been played or so I've heard.
Friends are telling me -
it's the same as smoking herb.
Like..

You got me feeling so good.
I put my bets on _you_..
You got me feeling so good.

I felt the
glow in my face
<span class="l1">as the limelight struck
but I'm reminded by King Midas
not to test my luck.</span>
Love the ones who keep you humble cause
they come a dime a' _dozen_,
_dancing_ to the memories we
make to the percussion.
Like..

You got me feeling so good.
I put my bets on _you_.
Hey, I put my bets on you..

Just to my
mom and my dad,
you know the way I love you -
<span class="l1">when things start to get heavy
I put nothing else above you.</span>
Cause I see it in your eyes,
catch me out my scheming.
<span class="l1">Pockets empty, still you gave me
something to believe in.</span>

And you got me..
_ta-da-da-dun_
_a-si-ta-tu-si-ta-tu-te_

I put my bets on _you_.
Hey, I put my bets on _you_..
You got me..
_ta-da-da-dun_

You got me feeling so good.
I put my bets on _you_..
You got me feeling so good.

_ta-da-da-dun_

I put my bets on _you_..
You got me feeling so good.
Hey, _ta-ton-ta-ton_..
