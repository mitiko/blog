Searching for balance, praying for clarity,
ma stripped me naked, take this identity
tell me it's unity.
<span class="translation" title="I am another you, and you are another me.">In Lak'ech Ala K'in.</span> I am you, you are me.
Searching for balance, praying for clarity,
ma stripped me naked, take this identity
tell me it's unity.
<span class="translation" title="I am another you, and you are another me.">In Lak'ech Ala K'in.</span> I am you, you are me.

I wear clothes, I like to hide
so no one knows what I'm made from
deep in my soul.
Taken from home so far we stroll
deep in these roads.
Think we control this shit; we don't
but fuck we could. I wish we would
throw away these phones, get a bit more holy,
see the world more slowly, ten test my roses

Searching for balance, praying for clarity,
ma stripped me naked, take this identity
tell me it's unity.
<span class="translation" title="I am another you, and you are another me.">In Lak'ech Ala K'in.</span> I am you, you are me.
Searching for balance, praying for clarity,
ma stripped me naked, take this identity
tell me it's unity.
<span class="translation" title="I am another you, and you are another me.">In Lak'ech Ala K'in.</span> I am you, you are me.

See all I know is that I know
nothing at all. This shit is so
mystical, magical.
I know we don't know our potential.
How could we when they lie, they cast spells
and they try dropping bombs from the skies
like we are not stars.
Inside me there's a war..
<span class="translation" title="Victory to the divine mother.">Jai Maa, Jai Maa.</span>

Searching for balance, praying for clarity,
ma stripped me naked, take this identity
tell me it's unity.
