Complimenting my style, you know;
<span class="l1">pushing me to my prime, you know.
Maybe timing's divine - so swing my way.</span>

Are you tired of love songs yet?
Or do you wanna <span class="l1">explore what's next?</span>
<span class="l1">Bedsheets and latex</span> - so come my way.

Ain't no price tag I won't pop for you - I'm on it.
<span class="l1">I'll be laced down, newest retail on my body.
Smells good, soft to the touch, how you want it?
Here in 4k when you're at work -</span>
waitin' for the day to end;
and I'm sane.. but I can't pretend
that you ain't.. drivin' me crazy.
That's when you tell me...

There ain't nothin' nothin' nothin' I won't do
_there ain't nothin' I won't do_
I'd go to the ends of the earth to please you.
_just to please you_
Oh there ain't nothin' nothin' nothin' I won't do
_there ain't nothin' I wouldn't do_
I'd go to the ends of the earth to please you
<span class="l1">_things I'd do just to please you_</span>

So you work it.. love it how you work it.
Knead all of the knots cause I'm the bun and you be cookin'.
Sittin' on the counter fridge is lighting up the kitchen
and you eat all of my groceries leaving nothing for taking.
And morning we bakin'.. relaxin' my senses.
<span class="l2">Eve ate up the apple - you and I the consequences.
Can't have just a little, you gon' need more than a bite.
I know God turning his back when we be turning out the lights.</span>

There ain't nothin' nothin' nothin' I won't do
I'd go to the ends of the earth to please you.
_ends of the earth, just to please you_
Oh there ain't nothin' nothin' nothin' I won't do
I'd go to the ends of the earth to please you
_things I'd do just to please you_
