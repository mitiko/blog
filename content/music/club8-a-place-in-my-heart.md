As rain falls on your feet
you stop and stare
<span class="l1">and it's so clear that I want you.</span>

I don't know your name.
It's all the same,
you've got a place in my heart.

It looks so good
and maybe it could be
if we both tried.
<span class="l1">Falling apart
could be a start
and I don't mind.</span>

The streets do look quite dark.
<span class="l1">They're closing down
something that we started.</span>

There's no way to go.
We need some light
<span class="l1">we need an open space here.</span>

It looks so good
and maybe it could be
if we both tried.
Falling apart
could be a start
and I don't mind.

There no time, well there's some time
but it's never the right time.
