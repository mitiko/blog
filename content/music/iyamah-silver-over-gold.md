Air pollution fills my lungs.
Look at who I have become.
Lost my shine like the city sun.
Mister blue and mister gray.
Of my seaside childhood days
since I moved away.

Dreamt of my songs on the radio
but I ain't that yet, still got a way to go.
And now I'm missing home.
I left the back way, call a stereo.
Pack up my suitcase and hit the road..
all alone.

Mama taught me what I know.
<span class="l1">She said: "Life is hard if truth be told;
you don't always get the things you're owed -
that's why I wear silver over gold"</span>

Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

<span class="l1">I swear the ocean's never cold
when you're only six years old.</span>
My feet in if they feel the stones,
feet go in they feel at home, yeah.
Now home is just a little boring;
I carry it around while I turn.. ayy.

Ooh, ooh
