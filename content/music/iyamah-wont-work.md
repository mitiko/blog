Yeahh!
Why you asking questions? Why wondering where I am?
<span class="l1">Why you always wanna include me in all your plans?
Why you gotta be the one to tell them you're my man?
If you really were d'you think you'd have to say that?</span>

Don't you know the reason why I'm here is cause of me?
<span class="l1">I don't need your money I stand on my own two feet.</span>
Boy you know I'm independent yeah, and that's a fact.
That's the way it's always been - so don't try and change that. No!

I can't be your princess!
I can't be your queen!
And na na na na, no it won't work with me!
Slipping through your fingers
untied at the seams.
Na na na na, no it won't work!

I like to set my boundaries so I know when to stop.
And so you know I'll wear the trousers put me on the top.
<span class="l1">I don't need your muscles baby I'll put up the shelf.
Are you feeling threatened, well go find somebody else.
I grew up with my single mother see her as the king.</span>
Thats the way I learnt so I'm sticking to the routine.
<span class="l1">Power to the females, we don't miss the details.</span>
I can see the way that you want me, yeah!

And I can't be your princess!
I can't be your queen!
Na na na na, no it won't work with me!
Slipping through your fingers
untied at the seams.
Na na na na, no it won't work.. with me, yeah!

<span class="l1">Come buy me diamonds, cause I like stones.
And catch me in silver, never gold.
You say I'm cryptic, but that's just old.
I'm a lone soldier!</span>
Come buy me diamonds, cause I like stones.
And catch me in silver, and never gold.
You say I'm cryptic, but bb..bb..bb..boy, oh...

It won't work with me and I know I can't be your queen.
Na na na na, no it won't work with me!
Slipping through your fingers
untied at the seams.
Na na na na, no it won't work!

Come buy me diamonds, cause I like stones.
And catch me in silver and never gold.
And you'll say I'm cryptic, but...

Come buy me diamonds, cause I like stones.
And catch me in silver, never gold.
<span class="l1">And you'll say that I'm complicated like you've never known.</span>
