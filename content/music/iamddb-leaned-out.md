_Goodbye-ye, bye-bye.._
IAMDDB, keep it G, of course!
Bitches so sour, but it's mermaid season.

Suffering, energies.
Broken pockets, broken G's.
I have all the time, to succeed
happily, wimma G's.

I'm sitting here on my own
feeling confused I'm slightly,
amused by it all. I'm wavey.
You have no control.
My mind is .. blossoming lately.
You think you're the wave I beg to differ.
I, inherited the wave. I am different
cloths, different prices, different scars.
Different, seduction, abduction.

<span class="l1">I cannot and won't conform,
I'll do it all on my own.
I keep it G all the time, always left wondering why I
cannot fit in. I am
so different. I might stand
up on my ones. I might buss a 1 2 step. I might just
keep it serious, stay delirious.</span>
I might get sick of ya,
I might be sick widdya oh
_well-well-well-well-well-well-well_.
I am tired, I am so damn tired!

'Cause I'm whippin' it like I'm coca,
leaning oh so far.
I'm over the limit ah
can't stop it I'm swervin' ah
I'm leanin' of love and ah
I'm going under 'cause I'm, leaned out.

Yes I am leanin'.
Yes I am leanin' out.
I am really leanin'.
DDB is winning now.

**Lean**, working like a machine.
Got me swervin' on the M1, got me feeling like I'm the one.
Possibilities I like to tie with but don't ever tie me down with that shit
I get my own, and own all of my shit.
Stupid woes all in my ish yea look at my pictures they look so sweet (_so sweet_).
You wanna try send for me but don't @ me when you know full well you know my @ name like.
Really ho?
Not today, don't push me to my limits,
not today, not feeling to catch no bodies.

I cannot and won't conform,
I'll do it all on my own.
I keep it G all the time, always left wondering why I
cannot fit in. I am
so different. I might stand
up on my ones. I might buss a 1 2 step.
I might just..

'Cause I'm whippin' it like I'm coca, (_coca_)
leaning oh so far.
I'm over the limit. I can't stop it, I'm swervin', I'm leanin' of love and I'm going under. (_under_)
'Cause I'm leaning.. I was leaning..
Yes I'm leanin'.
'Cause I am leanin' out.
I am really leanin'.
'Cause DDB is winning now.

I might have to pull the trigger.
I might have to pull this trigger.
Because IAMDDB.
