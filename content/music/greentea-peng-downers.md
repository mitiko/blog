I can't smell the flowers.
Felt empty now for hours.
Lost my powers.
I can't smell the flowers,
I'm sick of all these towers,
think I done too many downers.

<span class="l1">Hard to see the value in these half-hearted encounters.
Can't deal with the truth
so we just change the world around us
to feel and smell just like we want it to.
Fuck what we're meant to do.</span>
Can't hang 'round, be no fool
wasting time just getting high.

Getting high to get by.
Clear my mind, yeah, blue skies.
All this time I've been flying
from up here..

I can't smell the flowers.
Felt empty now for hours.
Lost my powers.
I can't smell the flowers
and I'm sick of all these towers.
Done too many downers.

<span class="l1">Stuck inside a space
I have created for myself
to be 'round no one else.</span>
I'm working on my spells
to get me out here.

Oh, yeah, your words are wisdom.
Oh, yeah, you keep on giving.
But nah, there's no forgiving.
And, yeah, I'm overthinking.
Some days I am just sinking.
Static, nah, I ain't driven.
Talking, but I ain't listening.

I can't smell the flowers.
Felt empty now for hours.
Lost my powers.
<span class="l1">I can't smell the flowers and
I'm sick of all these towers.
Done too many downers.</span>

I can't smell the flowers.
<span class="l1">Been hanging out for hours. Where's my powers?
And I'm sick of all these towers towering over me.
Feeling fucking lonely
like no one even knows me,
not even my own homies.</span>

Getting high to get by.
Clear my mind.
Yeah, blue skies.
All this time I've been flying
from up here..

I can't smell the flowers.
Felt empty now for hours.
Lost my powers.
I can't smell the flowers.
I'm sick of all these towers.
Too many downers.

I can't smell the flowers.
Felt empty now for hours.
Lost my powers.
I can't smell the flowers.
I'm sick of all these towers.
Too many downers.
