<span class="l1">Woman I think I love you,
cause I can't stop thinking of you.</span>
It's too late, now you're gone.
It's your fate from moving on.

I can't think of anybody but you!
I can't think of anybody but you!
I can't think of anybody but you!
I can't think of anybody but you!
I can't take it.

<span class="l1">Did you forget about me?
I can't forget about you!</span>

Woman, listen to me,
in my mind you're all I see.
Made up, like a dream -
it's only make believe.

<span class="l1">I can't think of anybody but you!
I can't think of anybody but you!</span> _(you're all that's on my mind)_
I can't think of anybody but you! _(you're all that's on my mind)_
I can't think of anybody but you!
And I can't take it.

Woman,
did you forget about me?
I can't forget about you!

I can't think of anybody but you! _(you're all that's on my mind)_
I can't think of anybody but you! _(you're all that's on my mind)_
I can't think of anybody but you! _(you're all that's on my mind)_
I can't think of anybody but you!
And I can't take it.
