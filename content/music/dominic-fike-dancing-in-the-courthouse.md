<span class="l1">Weather controls your day.
People make up your mind.</span>
Until you can't even tell
when someone gives you a sign.

<span class="l1">But we make the ground our grave by layin' in it.
We make our problems fade by facin' 'em.</span>
We make the wind our wings by raisin' your arms.
At the top of the world, yeah!

Put 'em ... on trial. _trial_
Make 'em dance for it in the courthouse.
Make a stand for it or it don't count. _or it don't count_
Be the landlord of the whole town.
Put 'em ... on edge.
Make thе judge jump and hit the two-step. _hit thе two-step_
And make the jury come up with two guesses. _two guesses_
And lose interest, then they make up a new sentence.

Ayy, hell or high water, we cover for you like camouflage.
And it's not over 'till a fat woman sing hella high _hey_.
Tap dancin' in my... _hey_
<span class="l1">until I feel a change in my day to day on a daily basis.</span>

We make the love that keeps our world spinnin'.
We make the gods our friends by cursin' em.
We make the wind our wings by raisin' your arms.
At the top of the world, yeah!

<span class="l1">Put 'em ... on trial. _trial_
Make 'em dance for it in the courthouse.
Make a stand for it or it don't count. _or it don't count_
Be the landlord of the whole town.</span>
Put 'em ... on edge.
Make thе judge jump and hit the two-step. _hit thе two-step_
And make the jury come up with two guesses. _two guesses_
And lose interest, then they make up a new sentence.

Some do plannin', she livin' like a loose cannon.
Then lose, man, that's so funny, I should do standup.
I'm rude, and a superhero like Bruce Banner
but truth is, ain't nothin' that you could do.

Put 'em ... on trial. _trial_
Make 'em dance for it in the courthouse.
Make a stand for it or it don't count. _or it don't count_
Be the landlord of the whole town.
Put 'em ... on edge.
Make thе judge jump and hit the two-step. _hit thе two-step_
And make the jury come up with two guesses. _two guesses_
And lose interest, then they make up a new sentence.

Put 'em ... on trial.
Make 'em dance for it in the courthouse. _in the courthouse_
Make 'em dance for it in the courthouse.
