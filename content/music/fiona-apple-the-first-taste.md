I lie in an early bed thinking late thoughts
waiting for the black to replace my blue.
<span class="l2">I do not struggle in your web
because it was my aim to get caught.
But daddy longlegs, I feel that I'm finally growing weary
of waiting to be consumed by you!</span>

Give me the first taste.
Let it begin, heaven cannot wait forever.
<span class="l1">Darling, just start the chase, I'll let you win
but you must make the endeavor.</span>

Oh, your love give me a heart contusion.
Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red.
<span class="l2">Your hungry flirt borders intrusion
and I'm building memories on things we have not said.</span>

Full is not heavy as empty, not nearly, my love
not nearly, my love, not nearly..

Give me the first taste.
Let it begin, heaven cannot wait forever.
Darling, just start the chase, I'll let you win
but you must make the endeavor.

The first taste.
Let it begin, heaven cannot wait forever.
Start the chase, I'll let you win
but you must make the endeavor.
