Fly through the night, fly like everyone I know;
like everyone, I've been conceited.
Fly through the night, doesn't matter where you go.
<span class="l1">When you leave, I feel so defeated.</span>

Oh, you don't know where you're from?
And you got nowhere to go?
<span class="l1">Don't taunt me with your story, cause I've got my own.
Never better, just less immediate.
You come and go, but I love you so (so)</span>

Easily, I'm the sweetest damn thing you ever saw.
Easily, suddenly, you don't know me at all.
Easily, three years later and now you wanna call.
Easily-y-y-y

Easily _(so, you)_
Easily _(so, you)_
Easily _(so, you)_
Easily-y-y-y

(Oh, no-no-no-no-no)

Easily, I'm the sweetest damn thing you ever saw.
Easily, suddenly, you don't know me at all.
Easily, three years later and now you wanna call.
Easily-y-y-y
