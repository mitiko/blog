Why did you bring me here? Or was I doomed for this?
A little liquor still lingers on my bruised lips.
<span class="l1">I take a cigarette and light it on the counter stove
but now I'm older I can't blame it on the other kids.</span>

It seems like everywhere I look I see my past again.
Remember playing ring a rosy in the grass.
I wonder then if Mrs Maples thought she knew me well
and said "that little girl's gonna end up like her mam". Fuck!

This is the calm before the storm - it starts at 3 PM.
I smoke my blem and wait for déjà vu to strike.
<span class="l2">He says he loves me but he treats me like he doesn't, huh.
I see an addict when I look into his eyes.</span>

Like all these settings they just seem so damn familiar.
<span class="l1">My heart is breaking when I see my mother cry.</span>
But I keep living on a loop and to the same effect.
<span class="l1">This time is different where I'm really gonna try.</span>

I get high
only 'cause you always make me teary-eyed.
Said, I.. get high
only 'cause you always make me teary-eyed.

So, baby please tell me if I be too strong
and maybe take a little less next time when you write this song.
I've been wrong before but now I'm pretty certain -
<span class="l1">you're always gonna pull for me, even when I'm hurting.</span>
I've been the disturbing murmurs in the back of your turning, uh.
Said he tried to tell me, wrap me up and keep burning.
Steep learning but that's how I get through to you -
I make you spin a few, and maybe (?) treat me cool.
I make you beautiful.
Your mama told you that I'm the roots of Lucifer.
I said I'm grown in the home of the ruthless of the future.
Tryna be on the level of the boss guys.
Lost fights, lost lives.
<span class="l2">Reminiscing as I get lost in your locked eyes.</span>
Burned to burgundy, third-degree.
Surgery is a procedure, I reverse courteously.
I'll help you murder beats if you just learn from me.
Drive you to the heights, see the lights, and don't swerve.
I'll fuck you up.

I know what you wanna do.
<span class="l1">Know that it's not good for you.
But you can't kick the habit. (baby)</span>

I know what you wanna do.
Know that it's not good for you.
But you can't kick the habit. (baby)

I get high
Only 'cause you always make me teary-eyed.
Said, I.. get high
Only 'cause you always make me teary-eyed.
(Yo!)
