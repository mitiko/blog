more poetry in this one
sort of like a scrunched up paper thrown into the abyss

linux kernel development culture and ideas

consistency and consequence

tea and cigarettes

breakups are good because they kill your ego
my best days are after the breakup
i get to see my friends more
i feel more alive
without an ego weighing you down, you can experience so much more of the world around you
it's raw, it's powerful, it's real

the moon and the sun

she hides during the day
the vow of darkness must be held
her body as frail as a watery reflection
she is shortly here as a guest

he roams the room from dawn to dusk
every home was a new home once
his everlasting energy divided by naps

when they meet it's chaos.
why can't they be friends, they both love to cuddle.
but no.
she gets chased away by him.
why does he do it, is he jealous?
of course he's jealous, that was _his_ home before he met her!
she returns.
why does she come back, isn't she scared?
of course she's scared, but curiousity never killed the cat!
it's a dance, an entanglement, no rush
